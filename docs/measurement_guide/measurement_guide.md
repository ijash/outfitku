8. **Waist** Measure your waist at the smaller circumference of your natural waist, usually just above the belly button.
9. **Hip** Measure at the widest part of your lower hip.
10. **Head Circumference** For an accurate head measure, place a tape measure across the forehead and measure around the full circumference of the head. Keep the tape snug for accurate results.
